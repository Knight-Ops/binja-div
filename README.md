#Binja-Div

The idea of this plugin is to be able to comment divide functionality from the Binary Ninja LLIL. Very basic functionality is currently implemented with mulu.dp LLIL command.

If you find something that this plugin will not work for, please open an issue. IN ITS CURRENT STATE I WOULD EXPECT MORE FAILURES THEN PASSES.
